# Real A.L.F.R.E.D.
A.L.F.R.E.D. was a project I created to keep track of my weekly tv shows and were to watch them.  
It has provider scrapping for the content in cloud functions on-demand.  
At some point it had cronjobs to scrape the provider, a server-side rendered frontend platform hosted on heroku, noSQL database and integration with google assitant for new episodes prompting.

## alfred-assitant

## alfred-platform
Currently just cloud functions that scrape the provider. But in the history there is a full server-side rendered platform
