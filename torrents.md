## Real A.L.F.R.E.D.
A.L.F.R.E.D. was a project I created to keep track of my weekly tv shows and where to watch them.  
At some point it had cronjobs to scrape the provider, a server-side rendered frontend platform hosted on heroku, noSQL database and integration with google assitant for new episodes prompting.
